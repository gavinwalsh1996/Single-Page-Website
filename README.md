<h1>Summary</h1>
The goal of this project was to build a static responsive webpage using React and Tailwind.

This was a fun project and I definitely found it challenging at times as I decided to style it with Tailwind which is still a new framework for me.
Tailwind is a great tool and has some great features such as DarkMode but it can be difficult to create pixel perfect designs as you have to make some custom classes to achieve this.
It was a geat project to practice functionality as I've been focusing a lot on this lately. I really enjoyed creating some of the functions for the slideshow and the dark mode feature. 

With all that been said, I took a lot from this project and definitely improved my overall web design skills which is the end goal of any project.

If I was to improve on this project in the future, I would add some CSS animations for some of the elements and would also set up some routes to build the pages in the navbar.
